 The Rock Paper Scissors game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

 It allows the player to compete against the computer in a simple, interactive format.

 The game logic is implemented in JavaScript, handling the core gameplay and user input.

 The CSS patterns were enhanced using AI-generated styling, adding a unique and visually appealing theme to the interface.

 The layout is responsive and designed to work smoothly across different screen sizes.

 The AI-assisted design approach adds a creative touch that sets this version apart from standard implementations.

 This project showcases a balanced blend of functionality and creativity, perfect for both beginners and design enthusiasts.
